     <h3> Our Mission: </h3>
     <p>A Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program offers a route through which consumers are able to buy fresh agricultural products from local farms and strives to promote environmental, ecological, and economic sustainability. The Dalton CSA (DCSA) will benefit both local farms and the Dalton community by supporting environmentally friendly and sustainable agriculture.  DCSA will offer “shares” to its consumer members, allowing them to invest in member farms and community development and receive fresh seasonal produce delivered weekly throughout the year.  We seek to bridge the gap between supply and distribution, supporting small (ideally organically-certified) farms throughout the greater New York region.   </p>
       <p>DCSA will make sustainability education a priority by encouraging healthy eating and food awareness through student-initiated learning experiences: the educational value of the DCSA will be highlighted.  Furthermore we will promote the idea of sustainable and healthy eating beyond the Dalton community through various outreach efforts.  
 
The Dalton CSA will be fully planned, managed and staffed by Dalton students as a cooperative effort, supported by and reinforcing the Dalton community. DCSA will be grounded in the principles of the Dalton Plan and will provide valuable hands-on business and social entrepreneurship experience, underscoring the essential features of community and cooperation, and celebrating student initiative.  </p>
